2015-2019
Homeowner demographics by county recording race, area-median-income, cost of homeownership, and active mortgages, used to calculate other statistics useful for policymakers to better target Homeowner Assistance Fund dollars to the homeowners most in need; including median-monthly-ownership cost to income ratio and homeowners cost-burdened and severely cost-burdened in each county.


### Years of collection, level, etc. across datasets

https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html 

This dataset includes homeownersâ€™ demographic and income characteristics and assesses foreclosure risk in counties across the country. With these data, policymakers can better target Homeowner Assistance Fund dollars to the homeowners most in need.

This dataset contains the following information for counties in every state:

number of homeowners with incomes below 100 percent of the area median income, broken out by all homeowners and those with an active mortgage (2019 American Community Survey data, five-year estimates)

number of homeowners with incomes below 150 percent of the area median income, broken out by all homeowners and those with an active mortgage (2019 American Community Survey data, five-year estimates)

number of homeowners of color making between 100 and 150 percent of the area median income (2019 American Community Survey data, five-year estimates)

a predictive foreclosure rate showing foreclosures as a share of total homeowners, based on economic and housing market conditions (Urban Institute data)

share of all homeowners, by race or ethnicity (2019 American Community Survey data, five-year estimates)

median monthly housing costs and the share of homeowners who are cost burdened, defined as those spending at least 30 percent of annual income on housing (2019 American Community Survey data, five-year estimates)
